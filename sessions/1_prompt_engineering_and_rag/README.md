# AI in the news industry - prompting and RAG

In this two-part series, we will learn basic generative AI basics like prompt tuning and retrieval
augmented generation (RAG).

## Run instructions

- Start Jupyter kernel on Kaggle, with GPU support
- No need for any LLM API keys, we run an LLM within the Jupyter notebook
- Import the appropriate Jupyter Notebook, and start coding ... 

## Notebooks overview
There are two hands on exercises you can choose from. You may not have
time to complete both, so choose which one you want to start with:

- Part 1 -`part1_news_qa/news_qa.ipynb`: In this exercise, you will create a Q&A system for Reuters news articles.
Along the way, you leverage different RAG techniques, including
semantic search and TF-IDF, which you implement from scratch.
- Part 2 -`part2_quiz_generation/quiz_generation.ipynb`: Here you implement a quiz generator for news articles.
This exercise focuses on prompting, it is more high-level than the first, and you'll be
using LangGraph.
